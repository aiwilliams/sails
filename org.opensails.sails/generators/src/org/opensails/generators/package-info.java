/**
 * The interfaces and classes that define Sails code generators.
 * <p>
 * While it is not terribly complex to create code that plugs into Sails, it can
 * be made easier. Conventions are great, but can be difficult to remember perfectly.
 * The goal of the generator framework is to make code generation easy to define within
 * the context of Sails. A Domain Specific Language, if you will.
 * <p>
 * As of this writing, there is only one builtin code generator, ProjectGenerator.
 * It is not yet fully functional.
