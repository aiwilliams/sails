/**
 * A most excellent reflection library.
 * <p>
 * Sails and Viento are highly reflective in implementing their behavior. As we developed
 * these technologies, it became obvious that we needed to encapsulate all the code we were
 * writing into something that would help us keep from repeating ourselves. Also, there
 * can be a lot of code in doing something really simple, so we wanted it to be simple.
 * <p>
 * The best way to learn to use SpyGlass in your own code is to start looking at SpyGlass.
 * There are a number of static methods that will show you what is possible.
